## Summary
This is in response to a request for a code sample around some skeleton code form IronHack.

**IMPORTANT!** The code is meant to be a connversation starter. You will notice different technologies and styles used through differnet parts of the app so that each of them can be discussed with a practical example at hand.
This app would have been a perfect candidate for a reactive frontend framework, but since the exercise proposed the use of templates I stuck to that choice. Please be aware the .env file is of course missing from this repo (it was in .gitignore as standard practice to hide the api keys etc..) Here are the contents:
PORT=3000
ENV=development
MONGO_URL=127.0.0.1:27017
GMAPS_API_KEY=--------------------------------------

## Details
The following technologies are present at variuos levels in the code:
- Full CRUD on Express.js middleware and routing
- Mongoose ODM to MongoDB backend datawarehouse
- GoogleMapsAPI 3rd party service consumption
- Bootstrap (v4+) UI
- JQuery (v3+) UI
- JS Promises HTTP
- JS Async/Await HTTP
- Node.js (v.10+)
- ES2017 destructuring and lambdas
- CSS3 fluid layout and relative positioning
- HTML5 forms

# Express | Coffee & Books

## Introduction

Books and coffee are two very compatible things. If you think about it, a nice cup of a hot beverage and a book are two amazing things to have together.

In this exercise, let's create an app to save both bookstores and coffee places and display them. You could even use Google Maps to display a path from one place to the other.

:bulb: **Hint:** To accomplish this new challenge, feel free to follow the Google Maps & Express, the previous lesson.


## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

This exercise will help you to:
- Practice Google Maps API integration with an app
- Add location properties in your models as GeoJSON
- Display content from the database in a map

### Iteration 1 - create model

In `models` folder, create a new model `place.js`. For now, this model will have:

```bash
    - name,
    - type: coffee shop, bookstore
    - timestamps 
```

### Iteration 2 - create CRUD on this model

In this iteration, you should create full CRUD on `place.js` model - to be able to create, update, delete and display all the places you save in the database. You will have to create routes and corresponding views.

### Iteration 3 - add `location` property

- To be able to locate places on the map, you will have to add `location` property to its model (refer to the previous lesson if necessary);
- Add Location fields to form(s) - create and update
- Get Google Maps API Key
- Add Google Maps to the view(s) that will display the map
- Show places on the map & add markers to show placesâ€™ locations


## Extra Resources
- [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#introduction)
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)

Happy coding! :heart:
