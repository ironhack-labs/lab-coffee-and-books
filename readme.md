Books and coffee are two very compatible things. If you think about it, a nice cup of a hot beverage and a book are two  amazing things to have together.

In this exercise, let's create an app to save both bookstores and coffee places, then display them. You could even use Google Maps to display a path from one place to the other.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Then clone this repo.


## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```
- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.


# Instructions


::: success
:bulb: **Hint:** To accomplish this new challenge, feel free to follow the Google Maps & Express Learning Unit from the class
:::


Begin by creating a simple CRUD. You should have two different kind of places. Create a `place.js` file and add an attribute to set the kind of establishment.


- Add Location to Model
- Add Location fields to form
- Get Location & Save Places
- Show Places in Map -figure out if you can set a difference among them
- Get Google Maps API Key
- Add Google Maps to index.hbs
- The map
- Add Markers to show placesâ€™ locations
- Create a view to show places

## Summary
Now you should know how to:
- Add Google Maps to any application
- Incorporate GeoJSON attributes in a Mongoose Schema
- Display elements in a map with information from your apps Database

## Extra Resources
- [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#introduction)
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)

Happy Coding! :heart:
