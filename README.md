Express Basic Website
=====================

Pick a celebrity or other topic and use Express to make a Website for it.


Requirements
------------

**Your Website should have (at least) 3 pages:**

1. A home page
2. An "about" page
3. A photo gallery page

**Your site should also have a `public/` folder for:**

- CSS styling
- images
- (BONUS) some small front end JavaScript (click events, fade ins, popups, etc.)

Send your pull request before next class!


Structure of Your Code
----------------------

Your starter code only has an empty `app.js` file.
In addition to that, you will need:

1. a `package.json` file (run `npm init` to create one)
2. to install `express` npm (dont' forget to `--save` if you are using older versions of npm)
3. a `views/` folder for your separate HTML files
4. a `public/` folder for your publicly available files like CSS, images and (bonus) JavaScript
